        "  - NameObfuscator class with LCG random number generator",
        "  - 5 different realistic naming patterns that mimic Roblox internals",
        "  - Names look like: _CoreTest3Ref, UI_GUIObj5, _DevUI3A, SysRefB7, _IntGUI4Ptr",
        "  - Seed randomized every session using tick() + math.random()",
        "  - Each launch generates completely different names",
