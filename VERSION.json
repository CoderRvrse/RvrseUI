Replaces linear tween-based particles with GPU-efficient floaty bubbles using object pooling, adaptive density (FPS-based), and heartbeat-driven updates. Particles drift with lateral curl, varied sizes (3-28px), cubic easing, and soft bloom effects. Zero per-frame allocation, <0.8ms render budget."
