## Project Snapshot

- **Project**: RvrseUI v3.0.0 – modular Roblox UI framework
- **Entry points**:
  - `init.lua`: Modular loader that assembles everything from `src/`
  - `RvrseUI.lua`: Monolithic build generated by the tooling (kept for backwards compatibility)
  - `RvrseUI.backup.lua`: Retained as the safety copy requested by the team
- **Modules**: 26 focused modules under `src/` (Theme, Config, WindowBuilder, Elements, etc.)
- **Test script**: `TEST_ALL_FEATURES.lua` is now the *only* supported end-to-end test/demo
- **Language/runtime**: Luau running in a Roblox LocalScript context (client-side)

## Working Conventions

1. **Backups stay**: Never remove `RvrseUI.backup.lua` or other explicit backups without approval.
2. **Single test script**: All legacy demos/tests were removed. Extend `TEST_ALL_FEATURES.lua` if new coverage is required.
3. **Modular first**: Edit the files inside `src/`. Regenerate `RvrseUI.lua` only via the build scripts when necessary.
4. **Hotkeys/locks/config**: These systems are exercised by the master test suite. Maintain API parity when making changes.
5. **Documentation**: Update `README.md` (and other public docs) whenever APIs, usage, or testing flow change.

## Testing Workflow

- Quick smoke test: run `TEST_ALL_FEATURES.lua` in a LocalScript. It fetches `init.lua` from GitHub and drives every feature.
- Manual verification: interact with each tab to confirm the 12 elements, Notifications, Flags, lock groups, theme toggling, and configuration save/load.
- Additional checks: if you touch config/theme persistence, run in an executor that supports `writefile/readfile` to validate saves.

## Helper Notes

- `init.lua` returns the assembled `RvrseUI` table and prints diagnostic metadata. Scripts should call `Window:Show()` after creating elements so saved configs load correctly.
- `RvrseUI.lua` mirrors the modular content and is still consumed by existing users. Keep behaviour in sync.
- The build scripts read from `src/` and inject modules into the monolithic file—do not hand-edit generated sections.

Stay consistent with these expectations to keep the repository maintainable. Let the team know in PR summaries if you modify the build or testing story.
