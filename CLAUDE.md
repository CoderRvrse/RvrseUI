# RvrseUI â€“ Maintainer Notes (v3.0.2)

## Configuration Persistence Lockdown
- Save/load now routes through the live `RvrseUI` context (`src/Config.lua`) so every flagged element serializes correctly.  
- Theme cache (`_savedTheme`) is synced back to the active window; do not strip this hand-off.  
- Boolean `ConfigurationSaving = true` reuses the last profile by splitting `folder/file.json`; keep this parsing intact.  
- When touching persistence code, verify the executor supports `writefile/readfile/isfile` and rerun a full save â†’ load cycle with all 12 elements.

## Minimize Chip Alignment
- Chip drag now respects `ScreenGui.IgnoreGuiInset` and clamps using camera viewport size. If you change the host container, update the inset logic in `WindowBuilder` accordingly.

## Hotkey Pipeline
- `Hotkeys:Initialize` immediately wires `InputBegan` and prevents double hookups. Ensure any future hotkey changes toggle `_initialized` carefully.

## Quick Validation Checklist
1. Toggle each element flag, call `SaveConfiguration`, restart script, confirm values restore.  
2. Minimize to the ðŸŽ® chip, drag around edges, restore, then destroy via `Escape`.  
3. Confirm `ToggleUIKeybind` still acts globally after any hotkey changes.  
4. Run docs build (README badge/version) when bumping releases.
